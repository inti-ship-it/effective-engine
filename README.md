# Git Hub Assignment: Under normal circumstances, does a person who reclines their seat during a flight have any obligation to the person sitting behind them?

## I picked this question because I’ll be traveling soon, and I found it interesting. I wasn’t surprised by the majority opinion, but I was surprised that a significant number of people 311 believe there’s no obligation to the person behind them and see reclining as a personal choice. I found this surprising because I believe it’s important to be respectful of others. According to the data, the majority 543 people think passengers should respect the request not to recline, while 311 feel it’s up to the individual.

This is a chart I made to visualize the response to the question.
